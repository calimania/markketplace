# Database

## Postgress

Deploying to a database in our droplet, will migrate as we scale to more robust offers.

## Migration Path

If you start with a self-managed setup, plan for a future migration to a managed database. Here’s a simple migration path:

Regular Backups: Ensure you have automated and reliable backups of your database.

Monitoring and Alerts: Set up monitoring and alerts to keep track of database performance and issues.

Testing Migration: Periodically test the migration process to a managed database to ensure you can switch smoothly when needed.

Scalability Plan: Monitor your application’s growth and database performance to anticipate when a managed database might become necessary.
